# Overview

This comment section is currently an MVP-only. I plan to run performance and memory tests on it to ensure a pleasant experience for users. As of now, it serves as a good example of how I approach components' design and structure.

## Progress

There's going to have to be a few couple things that need to be checked before I can consider the comment section as an MVP.

As of yet, it's only possible to perform the following actions:

[X] Create a comment

[X] Reply to a comment

[X] Reply to a reply with the username pointing to the reply's user's username.

[X] Edit a comment or reply with the behavior being consistent regardless of what element will be modified.

[X] Delete a comment/reply consistently.

And these are the remaining actions:

[] Upvote/downvote a comment/reply.

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies
```
pnpm i
```

2. Run the project in development mode:
```
pnpm run dev
```

3. Enjoy!
