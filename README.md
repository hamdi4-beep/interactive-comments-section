# Overview

A comment section I'm working on that showcases my technical skills. The reason I'm building it is because I want to improve my critical thinking and problem solving skills in a space where I can make learning mistakes.

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies
```
pnpm i
```

2. Run the project in development mode:
```
pnpm run dev
```

3. Enjoy!
